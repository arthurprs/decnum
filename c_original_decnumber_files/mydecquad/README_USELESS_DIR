This rsql/quad/c_files/mydecquad directory is not used anymore !
================================================================

Compiling the "rsql/quad" package was a two-steps process:
	1) running "make", to compile the .c files using regular gcc. This produces a library into a temporary directory.
	2) running "go build", to compile mydecquad.c and mydecquad.h, and the .go files, and linking with the library created in step 1)

But it is more simple to put all necessary .c and .h files into rsql/quad directory, and let "go build" automatically compile these files along with the .go files.

This has been done on 2014-08-13.
