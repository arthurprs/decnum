This directory is not used anymore !
====================================

Compiling this package was a two-steps process:
	1) running "make", to compile the .c files using regular gcc. This produces a library into a temporary directory.
	2) running "go build", to compile mydecquad.c and mydecquad.h, and the .go files, and linking with the library created in step 1)

But it is more simple to put all necessary .c and .h files into the directory that contains .go files, and let "go build" automatically compile these files along with the .go files.

This has been done on 2014-08-13.

I keep this directory and files here just as a remainder, but I will eventually delete it...
